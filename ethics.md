This question is about the content of Homework 1.
If you didn't do this for last week's lab, accept Homework 1 on Pawtograder and read its instructions (in README.md).
Then, answer the following questions:

1. Why might a housing priority algorithm exist? Who creates it? What does it do for them?
2. To which responses will you assign scores in `points_for_additional_questions()`? In other words, other than `year`, `is_graduating`, and `num_credits`, what else might be useful in this calculation?
3. Who might be especially disadvantaged by the algorithm? Is there a way to "help them out" through `points_for_additional_questions()`?
4. Who might be unfairly advantaged by the algorithm? Whom does that harm? Can it be balanced out?
